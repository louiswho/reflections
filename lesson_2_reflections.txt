What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

  Initializing a repository builds a git directory for that repository,
  repositories need to be initialized in order to work on files using
  git functions like git log or git diff to track their history and make commits

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

  The staging area is a temporary directory for collecting the files to include
  in a commit. It's different from the working directory because the working
  directory contains the actual files while the staging area uses these files
  as references for the commit. And it's different from the repository because
  the repository contains both a working directory of files and the commits
  that pertain to them. The staging area is good because it allows you to group
  files together in order to combine related changes into a single commit.

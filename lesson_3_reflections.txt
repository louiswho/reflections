When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping
all your work local?

  A good case to use remote repositories would be when you work on files alone,
  but from multiple locations or when collaborating with other people

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

  By only pulling changes that you want from the remote repository, you preserve
  the state of your local repository while you are still working on it, by
  automatically syncing the remote repository to your local repository,
  Git could end up overwriting changes and commits you made but did not push to
  the remote repository yet, essentially reverting you back to an older version
  of the files and possibly causing significant lost progress.

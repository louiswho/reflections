When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping
all your work local?

  A good case to use remote repositories would be when you work on files alone,
  but from multiple locations or when collaborating with other people

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

  By only pulling changes that you want from the remote repository, you preserve
  the state of your local repository while you are still working on it, by
  automatically syncing the remote repository to your local repository,
  Git could end up overwriting changes and commits you made but did not push to
  the remote repository yet, essentially reverting you back to an older version
  of the files and possibly causing significant lost progress.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.
When would you use one instead of another?

  Forks are used only on GitHub and make a copy of the repository on your
  account, forking would be good for working on large projects or large groups
  of people so that you have your own copy of the code to make commits to, but
  to get them on the remote repository, the push requests would have to be
  verified by those with higher access privileges

  Clones are used to copy repositories from GitHub to your computer and can also
  be used to make copies of local repositories, clone would be good for
  experimenting with a repository someone made to learn how the code functions
  or for copying useful repositories that could be incorporated into your own work

  Branches are commits on their own timeline that can be seperate and merged
  when desired, branches could be used when you want to work on new features
  and keep them seperate from the main code until they are complete. Branches
  would also be good for groups working on different parts of code in the same
  file so that all needed changes could be merged back into one branch when ready

  What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
  stored locally?
    Having a copy of the last known state allows you to compare your version of
    changes with what has been committed to the repository.
